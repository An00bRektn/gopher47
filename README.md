## What is This? ðŸ¤”
This is a 3rd Party agent for the Havoc C2 written in Golang, mainly written as a learning project, but I'm sure it's still useful.

By the time this is out, you can read more about what and why this is at my blog: [here](https://notateamserver.xyz)

**Contributions welcome!** I don't plan on updating this all too regularly, but if I have fun making it I might add more stuff over time.

## Usage
Once you have your teamserver up, it's as simple as running the following:
- **Attacking Machine**: `python handler.py`
- **Target Machine**: `./gopher47`

You can use the Havoc GUI to compile it, or you can just edit the source code as you please and play with the Makefile, there isn't that much of it.

## FAQ

### Why Go?
I just wanted to have an actual Golang project put together that I can [point to](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/035/627/cover2.jpg).

### Will it evade AV/EDR?
idk, but grow up. Obfuscate and customize it yourself, stop being a baby.

### Why's the binary so large though?
Golang, along with Rust and other languages, compile **statically**, meaning all of the libraries necessary to run the executable are baked into the binary, which adds up. If you want to reduce the size, I won't do it by default, but check out [this link](https://github.com/xaionaro/documentation/blob/master/golang/reduce-binary-size.md) for some tips. **UPDATE**: I added an option to do some of this, but I'm sure there's more customization you could do :/

### Can I run multiple Gophers?
For now, not really. The current Havoc API only allows for one handler to be handled by one agent, and there really isn't a good, clean way to have multiple up at the same time. Reworks are in-progress but for now, there can only be one Gopher47.

### Is the communication encrypted?
No. As of version 0.4 of Havoc, there is no way to do a secure key exchange without straight up compromising keys. Once the system is reworked in the havoc-py interface, I will get that done.

### How's your day going?
I photoshopped a gun into the Golang gopher's hand for this at 1:00 AM, and my Winter break is over tomorrow.
